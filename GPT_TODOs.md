All set â€” I created a complete repo scaffold in the canvas titled "Sophies Universum - Telegram AI Vocabulary Trainer (Repo Scaffold)". It includes a ready README, bot.py, db.py, sm2.py, ai.py (AI stubs), requirements.txt, Dockerfile, .gitignore, and an MIT license.

Next steps you can ask me to do (I can do any of these right now):

Export the files as downloadable files (zipped) for you.

Implement real OpenAI integration in ai.py (I'll add concrete request/response parsing).

Convert the bot to the async v20 python-telegram-bot style or to Node.js.

Add tests, CI (GitHub Actions), or Docker Compose for production readiness.

Improve UX: ConversationHandler-based FSM, multi-language support, or web dashboard.

Which of those would you like me to do next?
